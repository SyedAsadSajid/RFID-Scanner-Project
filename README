Project that contains the code for an RFID Scanner with a GUI created to better manage a tools inventory. The main components of the project were an RFID Scanner 
and a raspberry pi, with a 3-D printed casing. The members that used the tool crib were than provided with verifiable RFID cards that they could use to access the 
toolcrib.
